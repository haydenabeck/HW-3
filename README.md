## Description

I was required to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. The criteria for password selection was based of the user being able to select which characters to include (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, or special). Each one of these parameters prompts the user to make a selection before moving on. 

## Technology Stack 
HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Usage
 A user can click a button and create a password populated by randomly generated characters of which the user can select their specific type (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, or special characters).
